# Neural Network Builder
It is a simple desktop program that allows building a Neural Network from scratch (without using any ML library) in Python.

# Concepts used in implementation:
* Mini-batch gradient descent
* sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent 
* Softmax
* Cross entropy loss
* Momentum

## For small discussion, about sample datasets and Neural Networks build for them, see PDF report
